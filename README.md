# GeneralizedProcrustes

Contains python scripts for the "The generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem in the high noise regime" paper.

-VarianceSigma.py: generates emprirical mean and variance of the estimator $\hat{\sigma}_{N}$

-PlotResults.py: plots the evolution of the empirical mean and variance of sigma

-AverageDonohoPlots.py: generates a number of instances and average them to get the graph in Figure 1

-FinalGeneration.py: display Donoho plots and compute the slopes of the lines
